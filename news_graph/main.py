We’re living through a fascinating era of rapid change for the blockbuster movie model. America producers, eager to get their $200 million movies into the lucrative Chinese market, are increasingly looking for Chinese production partners, shooting in Chinese locations, and adding China-friendly characters and plotlines to American movies, even including extra scenes just for the Chinese cuts of films. But simultaneously, China and other countries are moving toward the blockbuster model themselves, creating homegrown films that don’t need to involve American partners at all.

And just as American films attempt to find paydays in foreign markets, foreign blockbusters are coming to America. The Wandering Earth, described as China’s first big-budget science fiction thriller, quietly made it onto screens at AMC theaters in North America this weekend, and it shows a new side of Chinese filmmaking — one focused toward futuristic spectacles rather than China’s traditionally grand, massive historical epics. At the same time, The Wandering Earth feels like a throwback to a few familiar eras of American filmmaking. While the film’s cast, setting, and tone are all Chinese, longtime science fiction fans are going to see a lot on the screen that reminds them of other movies, for better or worse.

The film, based on a short story by Three-Body Problem author Cixin Liu, lays out a crisis of unprecedented proportions: the sun has become unstable, and within a hundred years, it will expand to consume Earth. Within 300, the entire solar system will be gone. Earth’s governments rally and unite to face the problem, and come up with a novel solution: they speckle the planet with 10,000 gigantic jets, and blast it out of its orbit and off on a hundred-generation journey to a new home 4.2 light-years away. The idea is to use Jupiter’s gravitational well to pick up speed for the trip, but a malfunction of the Earth Engine system leaves the planet caught in Jupiter’s gravity, and gradually being pulled toward destruction. A frantic group of workers have to scramble to reactivate the jets and correct the Earth’s course.

The action takes place in two arenas simultaneously. On the Earth’s frigid surface, self-proclaimed genius Liu Qi (Qu Chuxiao) and his younger adopted sister Han Duoduo (Zhao Jinmai) get roped into the rescue efforts after they run away from home. Han is just curious to see the planet’s surface — most of humanity now lives in crowded underground cities, and the surface is for workers only — but Liu Qi is nursing a deeper grudge against his astronaut father Liu Peiqiang (longtime martial-arts movie star Wu Jing) and grandfather (Ng Man-tat, whom Western audiences might recognize from Stephen Chow’s Shaolin Soccer). When Liu Qi was a child, his father moved to a newly-built international space station, designed to move ahead of Earth as a guide and pathfinder. Now an adult, Liu Qi feels his father abandoned him, and wants to strike out independently.

Meanwhile, on the space station, Liu Peiqiang is ironically a day away from completing his 17-year tour of duty and returning to Earth and his family when the crisis hits. The station’s artificial intelligence, MOSS, insists on putting the station’s personnel in hibernation to save energy, but Liu Peiqiang realizes the computer has a secret agenda, and he and a Russian cosmonaut set out to defy it.

The entire space plot may feel suspiciously familiar to American audiences, who have a strong emotional touchstone when it comes to a calm-voiced computer in space telling a desperate astronaut that it can’t obey his orders, even when human lives are on the line, because it has orders of its own. MOSS even looks something like the HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey: it’s represented as a red light on a gimbled panel, like a single unblinking, judgmental red eye. But a good deal of Liu Peiqiang’s space adventure also plays out like a sequence from Alfonso Cuarón’s 2013 Oscar-winner Gravity, with dizzying sequences of astronauts trying to navigate clouds of debris and find handholds on a treacherous moving station while tumbling through space.

Meanwhile, the Earthside half of the mission resembles nothing so much as the 2003 nonsense-thriller The Core, about a team trying to drill their way to the center of the Earth to set the planet’s core spinning again. Liu Qi and Han pick up a few distinctive allies along the way, including biracial Chinese-Australian gadabout Tim (viral video star Mike Sui), but mostly, the characters are drawn as blandly and broadly as in any American action movie, and a fair number of them get killed along the journey without ever having developed enough personality for audiences to feel the loss.

Pretty much any flaw The Wandering Earth can claim — flashy action scenes without much substance, a marked bent toward sticky sentimentality, an insistently pushy score that demands emotional response from the audience at every given moment — are familiar flaws from past blockbusters. Where the film really stands out, though, is in its eye for grandiose spectacle. Director Frant Gwo gives the film a surprising stateliness, especially in the scenes of the mobile Earth wandering the cosmos, wreathed in tiny blue jets that leave eerie space-contrails behind. His attention to detail is marvelous — in scenes where characters stand on Earth’s surface, contemplating Jupiter’s malicious beauty, the swirling colors of the Great Red Spot are clearly visible in reflections in their suit helmets.

No matter how familiar the plot beats feel, that level of attention not just to functional special effects, but to outright beauty, makes The Wandering Earth memorable. Not every CGI sequence is aesthetically impeccable — sequences like a vehicle chase through a frozen Shanghai sometimes look brittle and false. But everything having to do with Jupiter, Earth as seen from space, and the space station subplot is visually sumptuous. This is frequently a gorgeously rendered film, with an emphasis on intimidating space vistas that will look tremendous on IMAX screens.

And while the constant attempts to flee the destructive power of changing weather have their own echoes in past films, from The Day After Tomorrow to 2012, Gwo mostly keeps the action tight and propulsive. The Wandering Earth is frequently breathless, though the action occasionally gets a little muddled in editing. At times, particularly on the surface scenes where everyone is wearing identical pressure suits, it can be easy to lose track of which character is where. It’s often easy to feel that Gwo cares more about the collective rescue project than about any individual character — potentially a value that will work better for Chinese audiences than American viewers, who are looking for a single standout hero to root for.

But the film’s biggest strengths are in its quieter moments, where Gwo takes the time to contemplate Jupiter’s gravity well slowly deepening its pull on Earth’s atmosphere, or Liu Qi staring up, awestruck, at the gas giant dwarfing his home. In those chilly sequences, the film calls back to an older tradition of slower science fiction, in epic-scale classics like 1951’s When Worlds Collide or 1956’s Forbidden Planet. The interludes are brief, but they’re a welcome respite from chase sequences and destruction.

The Wandering Earth gets pretty goofy at times, with jokes about Tim’s heritage, or Liu Qi’s inexperienced driving and overwhelming arrogance, or with high-speed banter over an impossibly long technical manual that no one has time to digest in the middle of an emergency. At times, the humor is even a little dry, as when MOSS responds to Liu Peiqiang’s repeated rebellions with a passive-aggressive “Will all violators stop contact immediately with Earth?” But Gwo finds time for majesty as well, and makes a point of considering the problem on a global scale, rather than just focusing on the few desperate strivers who’ve tied the Earth’s potential destruction into their own personal issues.

Much like the Russian space blockbuster Salyut-7 was a fascinating look into the cultural differences between American films and their Russian equivalents, The Wandering Earth feels like a telling illustration of the similarities and differences between Chinese and American values. Gwo’s film is full of images and moments that will be familiar to American audiences, and it has an equally familiar preoccupation with the importance of family connections, and the nobility of sacrifice. But it also puts a strong focus on global collective action, on the need for international cooperation, and for the will of the group over the will of the individual.

None of these things will be inherently alien to American viewers, who may experience The Wandering Earth as a best-of mash-up of past science fiction films, just with less-familiar faces in the lead roles. But as China gets into the action-blockbuster business, it’ll continue to be fascinating to see how the country brings its own distinctive voices and talents into a global market. The Wandering Earth feels like the same kind of projects American filmmakers are making — accessible, thrill-focused, and at least somewhat generic, in an attempt to go down easy with any audience. But there’s enough specific personality in it to point to a future of more nationally inflected blockbusters. Once every country is making would-be international crossovers, the strongest appeal may come from the most distinctive, personal visions with the most to say about the cultures they come from.

Ever since 2017, when the new flat and fast course was introduced in the 11th　edition of the Tokyo Marathon, fast times are being recorded. The Tokyo Marathon is now a truly world class race.

Two years ago, a former world record holder Wilson Kipsang (KEN) recorded the Japanese all comers record of 2:03:58 on this course. In the same year, a marathon debutant Yuta Shitara (JPN, Honda) ran aggressively and for a while, stayed close to Kipsang. The race gave hope and courage to Japanese runners and fans, leading to the thoughts "Japanese can compete well at the world class level." 
Sequel to the drama, Shitara recorded Japanese record of 2:06:11 for the first time in 16 years. To add further excitement, the Japan Industrial Track & Field Association awarded Shitara with 100-million-yen prize money as part of "Project Exceed", a program launched to encourage athletes to break national records. Additionally, nine Japanese runners have cracked 2:10 for the marathon, showing that many of them are ready to compete at the world class level. I remember last year's race was nothing like previous years, leading to the new era for Japanese men's marathon.

This year, the 13th edition of the Tokyo Marathon, is expected to be even more exciting than the previous years.

On the men's side, Kenenisa Bekele (ETH), who has the personal best of 2:03:03, third fastest marathon in history on the standard course, head the field. Kenenisa, who is endowed with superior speed, won the gold medal at track events in both the 2004 & 2008 Olympics. He is known for his aggressive running style and thus likely to be the force to be reckoned with in Tokyo Marathon. Total of five 2:04 runners, including great tactician Dickson Chumba, the only two-time Tokyo Marathon champion (2014, 2018) on the men's side, and El Hassan El Abassi (BRN), who battled with Hiroto Inoue (JPN, MHPS) in the 2018 Asian Games, will start the race. Furthermore, two Kenyans with 2:05 marathon best are in the field. It is very interesting to see how the race will unfold.

The most fascinating runner in the field, at least from the Japanese perspective, is Suguru Osako (JPN, Nike Oregon Project), who recorded the national record of 2:05:50 in the Chicago Marathon in October. How will he run his first Tokyo Marathon? In the 2017 Boston Marathon, his debut, Osako recorded 2:10:28. In his second marathon, the 2017 Fukuoka Marathon, he improved his personal best to 2:07:19 before recording the national record in Chicago. He is steadily improving his personal best and his potential is unimaginable. By battling well against the runners from abroad including Kenenisa Bekele, perhaps he can improve his own national record again.

At the present time, two sets of pacemakers are planned for the men's race. First set of pacemakers will lead at 2:57-2:58 /km pace until 30km, targeting the time around 2:04:30 to 2:05:10. Osako, along with the Africans headed by Kenenisa Bekele are expected to follow the first set of pacemakers. I would also like to see other Japanese runners to follow these pacers to experience the world class races.
The second set of pacemakers will lead the runners at 3min/km to target the final time around 2:06:35. Ryo Kiname (JPN, MHPS), who finished seventh with 2:08:08 last year in Tokyo, as well as Shogo Nakamura (JPN, Fujitsu), who has the best of 2:08:16, have a potential to record 2:06 marathon. They probably target at least 2:07 marathon in Tokyo.

It is hard not to expect a great marathon from Kenta Murayama (JPN, Asahi Kasei). In the 10th edition of the Tokyo Marathon in 2016, Murayama was the only Japanese to stay with the lead pack as far as 22km. The impact he made in his debut marathon is unforgettable. Many imagine that Murayama runs better at a fast-paced marathon. If he is sucked into the fast pace, Murayama could move up several levels as a marathon runner.

In recent years, Japanese men's marathon is on the rise. Last year, Shitara and Inoue recorded 2:06 marathon in Tokyo. Later in the year, Inoue won the Asian Games marathon, Osako recorded the national record and first 2:05 marathon by Japanese in Chicago, and in December Yuma Hattori (JPN, Toyota Motors) became the first Japanese to win the Fukuoka Marathon in 14 years. With young and upcoming runners on the rise, the Japanese are closing on to the best in the world. I am determined to do everything possible for the race so that at least five Japanese will run 2:06 marathon before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

The women's field is also loaded this year with fast runners and thus the expectation for a great competition is high. The rising star from abroad is Ruti Aga (ETH), who recorded the personal best of 2:18:34 at the Berlin Marathon last September. Perhaps one set of women's pacemakers will aim for a 2:17 finishing time. In addition, there are three other runners with the personal best of 2:19 including Florence Kiplagat.

Among the Japanese women Honami Maeda (JPN, Tenmaya), who was second in the 2018 Osaka Women's Marathon and Keiko Nogami (JPN, 18 Bank), who won the silver medal at the 2018 Asian Games, will start the race. They have already qualified for the Marathon Grand Championships (MGC, the Japanese Olympic trial marathon). Yuka Takashima (JPN, Shiseido), who ran 10000m in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, is running her second marathon in her attempt to qualify for the MGC. Mao Ichiyama (JPN, Wacoal), making her marathon debut, is expected to run aggressively. Excitement is never ending for this year's race.

With the Tokyo Olympics just around the corner, elite runners, both men and women, are gathering in Tokyo to experience the Olympic course. It is exciting to see the world class competitions. If Osako and his Japanese rivals come close to the national record, it will add to the excitement. The history may be in making. Please enjoy the Tokyo Marathon 2019, the scene of world class runners running over the world class course.

RESEARCHERS WHO STUDY stylometry—the statistical analysis of linguistic style—have long known that writing is a unique, individualistic process. The vocabulary you select, your syntax, and your grammatical decisions leave behind a signature. Automated tools can now accurately identify the author of a forum post for example, as long as they have adequate training data to work with. But newer research shows that stylometry can also apply to artificial language samples, like code. Software developers, it turns out, leave behind a fingerprint as well.

Rachel Greenstadt, an associate professor of computer science at Drexel University, and Aylin Caliskan, Greenstadt's former PhD student and now an assistant professor at George Washington University, have found that code, like other forms of stylistic expression, are not anonymous. At the DefCon hacking conference Friday, the pair will present a number of studies they've conducted using machine learning techniques to de-anonymize the authors of code samples. Their work, some of which was funded by and conducted in collaboration with the United States Army Research Laboratory, could be useful in a plagiarism dispute, for instance, but also has privacy implications, especially for the thousands of developers who contribute open source code to the world.

How To De-Anonymize Code
Here's a simple explanation of how the researchers used machine learning to uncover who authored a piece of code. First, the algorithm they designed identifies all the features found in a selection of code samples. That's a lot of different characteristics. Think of every aspect that exists in natural language: There's the words you choose, which way you put them together, sentence length, and so on. Greenstadt and Caliskan then narrowed the features to only include the ones that actually distinguish developers from each other, trimming the list from hundreds of thousands to around 50 or so.

The researchers don't rely on low-level features, like how code was formatted. Instead, they create "abstract syntax trees," which reflect code's underlying structure, rather than its arbitrary components. Their technique is akin to prioritizing someone's sentence structure, instead of whether they indent each line in a paragraph.

'People should be aware that it’s generally very hard to 100 percent hide your identity in these kinds of situations.'

RACHEL GREENSTADT, DREXEL UNIVERSITY

The method also need requires examples of someone's work to teach an algorithm to know when it spots another one of their code samples. If a random GitHub account pops up and publishes a code fragment, Greenstadt and Caliskan wouldn't necessarily be able to identify the person behind it, because they only have one sample to work with. (They could possibly tell that it was a developer they hadn't seen before.) Greenstadt and Caliskan, however, don't need your life's work to attribute code to you. It only takes a few short samples.

For example, in a 2017 paper, Caliskan, Greenstadt, and two other researchers demonstrated that even small snippets of code on the repository site GitHub can be enough to differentiate one coder from another with a high degree of accuracy.

Most impressively, Caliskan and a team of other researchers showed in a separate paper that it’s possible to de-anonymize a programmer using only their compiled binary code. After a developer finishes writing a section of code, a program called a compiler turns it into a series of 1s and 0s that can be read by a machine, called binary. To humans, it mostly looks like nonsense.

Caliskan and the other researchers she worked with can decompile the binary back into the C++ programming language, while preserving elements of a developer’s unique style. Imagine you wrote a paper and used Google Translate to transform it into another language. While the text might seem completely different, elements of how you write are still embedded in traits like your syntax. The same holds true for code.

“Style is preserved,” says Caliskan. “There is a very strong stylistic fingerprint that remains when things are based on learning on an individual basis.”

To conduct the binary experiment, Caliskan and the other researchers used code samples from Google’s annual Code Jam competition. The machine learning algorithm correctly identified a group of 100 individual programmers 96 percent of the time, using eight code samples from each. Even when the sample size was widened to 600 programmers, the algorithm still made an accurate identification 83 percent of the time.

Plagiarism and Privacy Implications
Caliskan and Greenstadt say their work could be used to tell whether a programming student plagiarized, or whether a developer violated a noncompete clause in their employment contract. Security researchers could potentially use it to help determine who might have created a specific type of malware.

More worryingly, an authoritarian government could use the de-anonymization techniques to identify the individuals behind, say, a censorship circumvention tool. The research also has privacy implications for developers who contribute to open source projects, especially if they consistently use the same GitHub account.

“People should be aware that it’s generally very hard to 100 percent hide your identity in these kinds of situations,” says Greenstadt.

For example, Greenstadt and Caliskan have found that some off-the-shelf obfuscation methods, tools used by software engineers to make code more complicated, and thus secure, aren't successful in hiding a developer's unique style. The researchers say that in the future, however, programmers might be able to conceal their styles using more sophisticated methods.

“I do think as we proceed, one thing we’re going to discover is what kind of obfuscation works to hide this stuff,” says Greenstadt. “I’m not convinced that the end point of this is going to be everything you do forever is traceable. I hope not, anyway.”

In a separate paper, for instance, a team led by Lucy Simko at the University of Washington found that programmers could craft code with the intention of tricking an algorithm into believing it had been authored by someone else. The team found that a developer may be able to spoof their "coding signature," even if they're not specifically trained in creating forgeries.

Future Work
Greenstadt and Caliskan have also uncovered a number of interesting insights about the nature of programming. For example, they have found that experienced developers appear easier to identify than novice ones. The more skilled you are, the more unique your work apparently becomes. That might be in part because beginner programmers often copy and paste code solutions from websites like Stack Overflow.

Similarly, they found that code samples addressing more difficult problems are also easier to attribute. Using a sample set of 62 programmers, who each solved seven "easy" problems, the researchers were able to de-anonymize their work 90 percent of the time. When the researchers used seven "hard" problem samples instead, their accuracy bumped to 95 percent.

'Style is preserved.'

AYLIN CALISKAN, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY

In the future, Greenstadt and Caliskan want to understand how other factors might affect a person’s coding style, like what happens when members of the same organization collaborate on a project. They also want to explore questions like whether people from different countries code in different ways. In one preliminary study for example, they found they could differentiate between code samples written by Canadian and by Chinese developers with over 90 percent accuracy.

There’s also the question of whether the same attribution methods could be used across different programming languages in a standardized way. For now, the researchers stress that de-anonymizing code is still a mysterious process, though so far their methods have been shown to work.

“We’re still trying to understand what makes something really attributable and what doesn't,” says Greenstadt. “There’s enough here to say it should be a concern, but I hope it doesn’t cause anybody to not contribute publicly on things.”

    ITEM 11.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
    
    Interest Rate Risk
    
    Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess 
    cash, which is mostly held in interest-bearing bank deposits and wealth management products. 
    Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been exposed to 
    material risks due to changes in market interest rates, and we have not used any derivative 
    financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure.
    
    We may invest the net proceeds that we receive from our offerings in interest-earning instruments 
    Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of 
    interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due 
    to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected 
    if interest rates fall.
    
    Foreign Exchange Risk
    
    Our expenditures are mainly denominated in Renminbi and, therefore, we are exposed to risks related 
    to movements between Renminbi and U.S. dollars.
    To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to 
    foreign currency exchange risk. In addition, the value of your investment in our ADSs will be 
    affected by the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Renminbi because the value of our business 
    is effectively denominated in Renminbi, while our ADSs will be traded in U.S. dollars.
    
    The value of Renminbi against U.S. dollars and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, 
    among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy 
    adopted by the PRC government. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging 
    the value of Renminbi to U.S. dollars. Following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, Renminbi 
    appreciated over 20% against U.S. dollars over the following three years.
    Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between Renminbi 
    and U.S. dollars remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the PRC government has allowed 
    Renminbi to appreciate slowly against U.S. dollars again, and it has appreciated over 10% since 
    June 2010. On August 11, 2015, the People's Bank of China, or the PBOC, announced plans to improve 
    the central parity rate of Renminbi against U.S. dollars by authorizing market-makers to provide 
    parity to the China Foreign Exchange Trading Center operated by the PBOC with reference to the 
    interbank foreign exchange market
    closing rate of the previous day, the supply and demand for foreign currencies as well as changes 
    in exchange rates of major international currencies. Effective from October 1, 2016, the 
    International Monetary Fund added Renminbi to its Special Drawing Rights currency basket. Such 
    change and additional future changes may increase volatility in the trading value of the Renminbi 
    against foreign currencies. The PRC government may adopt further reforms of its exchange rate 
    system, including making the Renminbi freely convenible in the future. Accordingly, it is difficult 
    to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between 
    Renminbi and U.S. dollars in the future.
    
    To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars or other currencies into Renminbi for our 
    operations, appreciation of Renminbi against U.S. dollars would have an adverse effect on the 
    Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into 
    U.S. dollars or other currency for the purpose of making payments to suppliers or for dividends on 
    our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of U.S. dollars against 
    Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.

ITEM 11.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Foreign Exchange hiss

As we have begun sales of the ES8, the ES6, the EC6 and the all-new ES8, we expect that 
substantially all of our revenues will be denominated in RMB while our expenses are denominated in 
RMB and other currencies including the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling and the Euro. As a result, 
we are exposed to risk related to movements between the Renminbi and such other currencies. In 
addition, the value of our ADSs will be affected by the exchange rate between U.S. dollar and RMB 
because the value of our business is effectively denominated in RMB, while our ADSs will be traded 
in U.S. dollars.

The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set 
by the People's Bank of China. The Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times 
significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. 
government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the 
future.

To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation 
of the Renminbi against the
U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we receive from the conversion. 
Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments 
for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the 
U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amounts available 
to us.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the interest rates associated with the 
outstanding convertible notes we issued and bank loans that bear floating interest rates. The 
interest rate risk may result from many factors, including government monetary and tax policies, 
domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond 
our control. We may incur additional loans or other financing facilities in the future. The 
objective of interest rate risk management is to minimize financial costs and uncertainties 
associated with interest rate changes. We strive to effectively manage our interest rate risk by 
periodic monitoring and responding to risk factors on a timely basis, improve the structure of 
long-term and short-term borrowings and maintain the appropriate balance between loans with 
floating interest rates and fixed interest rates.

We are subject to interest rate sensitivity on our outstanding 2024 Notes, Affiliate Notes, 2026 
Notes and 2027 Notes. We account for our convertible notes on an amortized cost basis and our 
recognized value of the convertible notes does not reflect changes in fair value. Also, because 
convertible notes we have issued either bear interest at a fixed rate or bear no interest, we have 
not incurred financial statement impact resulting from changes in interest rates. However, changes 
in market interest rates impact the fair value of the convertible notes along with other variables 
such as our credit spreads and the market price and volatility of our ADSs and ordinary shares. 
Increases in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our outstanding 
convertible notes and decreases in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair 
value of our outstanding convertible notes. For information on the maturities and other contractual 
terms of our convertible notes, see “Item S. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Flows and Working Capital.”

With regard to interest rate sensitivity on our bank loans, we present the sensitivity analysis 
below based on the exposure to interest rates for interest bearing bank loans with variable 
interest rates as of December 31, 2020. The analysis is prepared assuming that those balances 
outstanding as of December 31, 2020 were outstanding for the whole financial year. A 1.0% increase 
or decrease which represents our management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in 
interest rates is used. Assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing 
interest-bearing bank loans balances with floating interest rates as of December 31, 2020, a 1.0% 
increase or decrease in each applicable interest rate would add or deduct RMB10.2 million (US$1.6 
million) to our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have not used any 
derivative financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure.


In addition, we may from time to time invest in interest-earning instruments. Investments in both 
fixed rate and floating rate interest-earning instruments carry certain interest rate risk 
associated with our investment return. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value 
adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less 
income than expected if interest rates fall.



To date, inflation in the PRC has not materially impacted our results of operations. According to 
the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the year-over-year percent changes in the consumer 
price index for December 2018, 2019 and 2020 were increases of 1.9%, 4.5% and 0.2%, respectively. 
Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we may be affected in the 
future by higher rates of inflation in the PRC. For example, certain operating costs and expenses, 
such as employee compensation and office operating expenses may increase as a result of higher 
inflation. Additionally, because a substantial portion of our assets consists of cash and cash 
equivalents and short-term investments, high inflation could significantly reduce the value and 
purchasing power of these assets. We are not able to hedge our exposure to higher inflation in 
China.

Seasonality

Demand for new cars in the automotive industry in general typically declines over the summer 
season, while sales are generally higher in the fourth quarter and spring time, especially from 
October to December and from March to April each year. Our limited operating history makes it 
difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any 
unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles.

macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic.Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been 
a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government regulations and shifting social behaviors have limited or 
closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. In 
some cases, the relaxation of such trends has been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent 
restrictions on gatherings or commerce, including in parts of the U.S., and the rest of the world. During 2020, 
we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide, and certain of our suppliers 
also shut down operations temporarily or permanently, including during the recently re-imposed lockdowns in certain 
parts of the world. We instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations 
were scaled back. Temporary impediments to administrative activities supporting our operations also hampered our 
product deliveries and deployments. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic 
continue to persist and may also have long-lasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the 
progress of the pandemic. For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent 
supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, 
increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors, which has caused challenges in 
our supply chain and production. In addition, labor shortages resulting from the pandemic, including worker 
absenteeism, may lead to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and service workers, as well as 
increased labor costs. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our 
suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation, including for travel 
and visa allowances. The contingencies inherent in the construction of, and ramp at, new facilities such as 
Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges.We cannot predict the duration or 
direction of current global trends or their sustained impact. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic 
conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately 
project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources 
accordingly. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at 
a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations 
again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.We may experience delays in 
launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control our manufacturing 
costs.We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new 
products and features. For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the 
initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for 
certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique 
manufacturing processes and design features for our products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to 
successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features. In particular, our future business depends in 
large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles including Model 3 and Model Y, which we are planning 
to achieve through multiple factories worldwide. We have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing Model 
3 and Model Y at high volumes and even less experience building and ramping vehicle production lines across multiple 
factories in different geographies. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient 
and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, 
high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, 
China and Germany. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. 
Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production 
ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If 
we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our Model 3 
and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets. We may also experience similar 
future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product 
versions or variants such as the recently updated Model S and Model X; new vehicles such as Tesla Semi, Cybertruck 
and the new Tesla Roadster; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence, such as new Autopilot 
or FSD 142/21/22 15!2010-K18/144https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.htm 
functionalities, the autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network and robotics. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the 
design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing 
facilities and products.  Any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the 
development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so 
cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating 
results. We may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing 
and vehicle charging networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.Our 
success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting with Model 3 and 
Model Y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited 
experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants at a 
limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not 
be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are 
commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products 
and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets. 
Because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our 
customers. We may face difficulties with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets 
requiring significant transit times. For example, we saw challenges in ramping our logistics channels in China and 
Europe to initially deliver Model 3 there in the first quarter of 2019. We have deployed a number of delivery models, 
such as deliveries to customersÕ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such 
models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to 
substantially increase our production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or 
inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Moreover, 
because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain 
authorized professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, 
or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume and relatively newer 
additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts 
inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the 
number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world. There is no assurance that we will be able 
to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets globally, 
that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of 
our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments 
and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our 
products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As 
we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions 
applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to 
our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, it may harm our 
brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.Our future growth and success are dependent 
upon consumersÕ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is 
generally competitive, cyclical and volatile. If the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in 
particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles 
decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and 
operating results may be harmed. We are still at an earlier stage of development and have limited resources and 
production relative to established competitors that offer internal combustion engine vehicles. In addition, 
electric vehicles still comprise a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our 
vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as: ¥perceptions about electric vehicle features, 
quality, safety, performance and cost;¥perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven 
on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities; ¥competition, including from other types of 
alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine 
vehicles; ¥volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline, such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020; 
¥government regulations and economic incentives; and¥concerns about our future viability.152/21/22 
15!2010-K19/144https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.htm Finally, 
the target demographics for our vehicles, particularly Model 3 and Model Y, are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles 
in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility.Our 
suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to 
us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.Our products contain thousands of parts purchased 
globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential 
sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, labor issues, wars, 
trade policies, natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan, health epidemics such as the global 
COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliersÕ 
control could also affect these suppliersÕ ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational. 
For example, a global shortage of semiconductors has been reported since early 2021 and has caused challenges in the 
manufacturing industry and impacted our supply chain and production as well. We have used alternative parts and 
programmed software to mitigate the challenges caused by these shortages, but there is no guarantee we may be able to 
continually do so as we scale production to meet our growth targets. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately 
forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, 
it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any 
component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and 
loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our 
capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant 
increases in our production, such as for Model 3 and Model Y, or product design changes by us have required and may 
in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. Our suppliers may not be willing 
or able to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, or to do so may cost us more, 
which may require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience 
outside of the Fremont Factory and we may experience issues increasing the level of localized procurement at our 
Gigafactory Shanghai and at future factories such as Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas. While we believe that 
we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, 
there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our 
continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to 
terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to 
produce, especially in light of the increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, 
prospects, financial condition and operating results.As the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also 
need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing 
facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of 
component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems 
to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production 
disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.We may be 
unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may 
experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there. Our ability to increase 
production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and 
workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future 
factories. The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject to a number of 
uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory 
requirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for 
additional expansion, potential supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and 
the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units 
at scale. For example, we are currently constructing Gigafactory Berlin under conditional permits in anticipation of 
being granted final permits. Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells 
and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes 
into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. We have limited experience to date with developing and implementing 
manufacturing innovations outside of the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai. In particular, the majority of our 
design and engineering resources are currently located in California. In order to meet our expectations for our new 
factories, we must expand and manage localized design and engineering talent and resources. If we experience any 
issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new 
factories, expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and 
complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for 
the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. 
We will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and 
manufacture of our own cells, and control our related costs.We are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion 
battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially more cells to grow our 
business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic 2/21/22 
15!2010-K20/144https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.htmand Contemporary 
Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number 
162/21/22 15!2010-K21/144https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.htm of such 
suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our 
suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to 
supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, 
manufacturable at greater volumes and more cost-effective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to 
develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, 
and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or 
at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production 
or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and 
operating results. In addition, the cost of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, 
depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other 
metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market 
conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric 
vehicles and energy storage products. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and 
any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased 
vehicle prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating 
results.We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new 
competitors. The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in 
the future. For example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in 
the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of 
established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans 
to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully 
electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software 
platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China 
and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater or better-established resources than we do to devote to the 
design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased 
competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and 
loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.We also face competition 
in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers 
of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of 
electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and 
lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs. Risks 
Related to Our OperationsWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at 
Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and 
energy storage products.Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products 
depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. 
In addition, we produce several vehicle components, such as battery modules and packs and drive units at Gigafactory 
Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, and we also manufacture energy storage products at Gigafactory Nevada. In the past, 
some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full 
capacity, and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and 
introduce new lines. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at 
Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai production, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and 
retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, 
which may harm our business and operating results. Finally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules 
and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of 
battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures 
related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells 
would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.We face risks 
associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain 
regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, 
political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets 
in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our 
operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming 
our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local 
operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; 
navigating foreign 17 '''

ITEM 11.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
   Foreign Exchange Risk
          The Company uses Renminbi (“RMB”) as its reporting currency. Most of our revenues and expenses are denominated in Renminbi. The functional
   currency of our company and subsidiaries in the United States and Hong Kong is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in the PRC, the
   VIE and the VIE’s subsidiaries is the Renminbi. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
   into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency during the
   year are converted into functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occurred. Transaction gains and losses are
   recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We had a foreign exchange loss of RMB11.8 million for fiscal year ended in 2018, a
   foreign exchange gain of RMB8.4 million in 2019, and a foreign exchange gain of RMB81.2 million (US$12.4 million) in 2020.

         We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge
   exposure to such risk. Although in general our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited, the value of your investment in our ADSs will be
   affected by the exchange rate between U.S. dollar and RMB because the value of our business is effectively denominated in Renminbi, while our ADSs will
   be traded in U.S. dollars.

          The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the PBOC. The PRC government allowed the
   Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, the exchange rate
   between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar had been stable and traded within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S.
   dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. On November 30, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the
   regular five-year review of the basket of currencies that make up the Special Drawing Right, or the SDR, and decided that with effect from October 1, 2016,
   Renminbi is determined to be a freely usable currency and will be included in the SDR basket as a fifth currency, along with the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the
   Japanese yen and the British pound. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Renminbi has depreciated significantly in the backdrop of a surging U.S. dollar and
   persistent capital outflows of China. This depreciation halted in 2017, and the Renminbi appreciated approximately 7% against the U.S. dollar during this
   one-year period. Starting from the beginning of 2019, the Renminbi has depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar again. In early August 2019, the
   PBOC set the Renminbi’s daily reference rate at RMB7.0039 to US$1.00, the first time that the exchange rate of Renminbi to U.S. dollar exceeded 7.0 since
   2008. With the development of the foreign exchange market and progress towards interest rate liberalization and Renminbi internationalization, the PRC
   government may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate system, and we cannot assure you that the Renminbi will not appreciate or
   depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the future. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may
   impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future.

                                                                                 112
Table of Contents

         To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have
   an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose
   of making payments for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the
   Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.


   Interest Rate Risk
          We have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates, and we have not used any derivative financial instruments to
   manage our interest risk exposure. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest
   rate in the future.

          We may invest the net proceeds we received from the IPO and our follow-on public offering in interest-earning instruments. Investments in both fixed
   rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely
   impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall.


   Inflation
         Since inception, inflation in China has not materially affected our results of operations. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the
   year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index for December 2018, 2019 and 2020 were increases of 2.1%, 2.9% and 0.2%, respectively.
   Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we may be affected if China experiences higher rates of inflation in the future.
